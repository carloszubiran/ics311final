        <h1> How to Play</h1>
    Powerball is America’s favorite game for a reason—millions upon millions of reasons, actually. Jackpots start at $40 million but can grow to hundreds of millions or more. Tickets are $2. Join in on the fun!
    
    
    <h1>The Basics</h1> 
    Leave it all up to luck and ask for a Powerball quick pick. Or, choose your own numbers. Pick five numbers from 1–69 and one Powerball number from 1–26. Play slips are available at lottery retailers.
    
    There are nine ways to win, starting with $4 for matching just the Powerball. Match the first five numbers plus the Powerball to win the jackpot.
    
    Your ticket could be worth millions of dollars—sign the back right away!
