        <h1> How to Play</h1>
        Jackpots start at $15 million and tickets are only a buck.
    
        <h1>The Basics</h1> 


        Leave it all up to luck and ask for a Mega Millions quick pick. Or, choose your own numbers. Pick five numbers from 1–75 and one Mega Ball number from 1–15. Play slips are available at lottery retailers.
        
        There are nine ways to win, starting with $1 for matching just the Mega Ball. Match the first five numbers plus the Mega Ball to win the jackpot.
        
        Your ticket could be worth millions of dollars—sign the back right away!
