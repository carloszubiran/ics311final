        <h1> How to Play</h1>
    The Twins, Jolly Green Giant, and six-month winters. Some of the best things are only available in Minnesota. Gopher 5 is one of those things. It only takes $1 to play for jackpots that start at $100,000          
  
    <h1>The Basics</h1> 
        Leave it all up to luck and ask for a Gopher 5 quick pick. Or choose your own numbers. Pick five numbers from 1 â€“ 47. Play slips are available at lottery retailers.
        
        Win by matching two, three, four or five numbers. Match all five to win the jackpot.
        
        Sign the back of your ticket right away; in a day or two, it could be worth $100,000 or more!
