        <h1> How to Play</h1>
        What’s better than winning a big jackpot? Taking it to the bank—all of it. Hot Lotto jackpots start at $1 million and they’re all cash. Is that hot enough for you?            
    
    <h1>The Basics</h1> 

        Leave it all up to luck and ask for a Hot Lotto quick pick. Or, choose your own numbers. Pick five numbers from 1–47 and one Hot Lotto number from 1–19. Play slips are available at lottery retailers.
        
        There are nine ways to win, starting with $2 for matching just the Hot Ball. Match the first five numbers plus the Hot Ball to win the jackpot.
        
        Your ticket could be worth millions of dollars—sign the back right away!
