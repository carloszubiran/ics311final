        <h1> How to Play</h1>
        Northstar Cash offers the best odds of any of our jackpot lotto games. Everyone knows that the North Star is the luckiest star so it’s no surprise that so many players have had stellar luck with this game. On average, the jackpot is won once every week. Jackpots start at $25,000 and sometimes grow into the six-digit territory.
      
        <h1>The Basics</h1> 

        Leave it all up to luck and ask for a Northstar Cash quick pick. Or choose your own numbers. Pick five numbers from 1–31. Play slips are available at lottery retailers.
        
        Win by matching two, three, four or five numbers. Match all five to win the jackpot.
        
        Your ticket could be worth a lot of money—sign the back right away!
